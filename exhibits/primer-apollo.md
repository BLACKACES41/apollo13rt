One of the biggest early decisions with Apollo was how exactly the spacecraft would be sent to the Moon and back such that it would have enough fuel. The Moon has its own gravity, of course, and while it isn't nearly as strong as the Earth's, it still costs a lot of fuel to land on and launch from it. Some felt like this wasn't a big deal, and that we could just send one gigantic rocket up, the whole ship would land on the Moon, and take off again to come home. A more likely candidate was the Earth-Orbit Rendezvous profile, which would have seen the Apollo spacecraft and fuel sent up to Earth orbit in chunks and assembled before departing for the Moon, again for a wholesale landing.

The idea that eventually won was instead the Lunar-orbit Rendezvous, initially dismissed as it was scary to contemplate rendezvous and docking maneuvers by the Moon, so far away from home. The idea was to minimize the amount of fuel one had to carry down to the Lunar surface, and thus minimize the amount of fuel required to then depart from the Moon. This is what led to the split Command/Service Module and Lunar Module spacecraft architecture. The CSM would stay in orbit around the Moon, so that the fuel needed to get home and the heavy components required to survive Earth re-entry would not have to descend to the Moon just to be lifted again. The Lunar Module could then be designed to be extraordinarily light.

Some systems and aspects were shared between the craft: they both used identical Apollo Guidance Computer hardware and shared some of the software, for example, and both burned the same flavors of hypergolic propellants for propulsion. But major differences existed as well: the CSM was powered largely from chemical fuel cells, for example, while the LM, which wasn't expected to be online for nearly as long, relied exclusively on batteries.

On the left, you'll find a simplified depiction of the Lunar-orbit rendezvous mission profile Apollo settled on. And below, we will describe briefly each component of the Saturn V launch vehicle and Apollo spacecraft.

Command/Sevice Module
---------------------

{{figure:arch-csm}}

Most of the trip was spent in the Command Module and relied on the mated Service Module for propulsion and consumables. This included the fuel cells that reacted Hydrogen and Oxygen to produce both electricity and drinking water, the cooling systems for the spacesuits and heat-generating electrical components, the Service Propulsion System hypergolic engine and propellant, and many small miscellenea. The two were mated before launch, and a ~46cm (18in) wide [umbilical](http://www.ninfinger.org/models/vault2005/More%20CM_SM_Umbilical%20pix/CSM.Umbil.Blk.II.Jpg) sent power, instrumentation signalling, and fluids between the two. A [temporary umbilical](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/5383523252) was run via the interior shared tunnel to the Lunar Module after docking to supply it with power.

The Command Module is often abbreviated to CM, the Service Module to SM, and the two together when mated were referred to as the CSM.

Lunar Module
------------

{{figure:arch-lm}}

As depicted in the film, one of the astronauts' first tasks once they were on the way to the Moon was something called Transposition, Docking, and Extraction. This involved separating the CSM from the top of the stack, slowly moving it away, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module. The combined stack would then be freed from the S-IVB booster stage. This process could take upwards of an hour. The LM would then be powered and pressurized.

The Lunar Module was built to be exceedingly light: its walls are famously thin, roughly 0.3mm (0.012in). It also had two propulsion systems, the heavier Descent Propulsion System (DPS) and the lighter Ascent Propulsion System (APS), so that the more powerful engine and the bulky landing gear could be left behind when leaving the Moon, along with heavy batteries and oxygen tanks for use during landing and the stay on the Moon. It was so small and compact that part of the APS engine assembly protruded into the cabin, and astronauts would often use it as a seat. The DPS was particularly unique in that it could be throttled, something none of the other engines on-board could do.

The Lunar Module was not meant for extended habitation, particularly in isolation from the CSM. It had limited supply of consumables like oxygen and water on board, and relied exclusively on batteries for power. Normally, the consumables would be used only during the Lunar phase of the mission, and the electricity would be replenished from the CSM fuel cells. These limitations would become some of the most important factors in planning for the survival of Apollo 13.

S-IVB
-----

{{figure:arch-sivb}}

The S-IVB (pronounced "S 4 B") stage was the final stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. It fired for the final stages of initial launch to bring the spacecraft into Earth orbit, and again to send it to the Moon, a maneuver known as Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI). In addition to its main hydrolox-powered J-2 engine, it also had small maneuvering thrusters on-board for attitude adjustments and ullage. Starting with Apollo 13, the S-IVB was directed to impact the surface of the Moon once separated from the Apollo spacecraft, as Apollo 12 had left seismic sensors on the lunar surface for scientific measurement.

The S-IVB also carried the Instument Unit (IU), the critical navigation, control, and communications system for the entire Saturn V launch vehicle. It also performed functions like providing its own cooling and detecting emergency scenarios.

In what would become a fateful design decision, the S-IVB IU communicated with ground stations on a similar frequency band as the Lunar Module. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, as by the time the LM was fully operational and needed communications, the S-IVB would have been disabled or would have impacted the Moon already. But on 13 the sudden need for the LM at an early stage would cause significant problems in the first hours of the accident.

S-IC / S-II
-----------

{{figure:arch-lv}}

The remaining two Saturn V stages were increasingly large boost stages. The S-II second stage was powered by the same J-2 engine as the S-IVB third stage, but had five of them. The S-IC stage had five of the immense F-1 engines which are to this day the largest engines ever flown.

Where the S-IVB burned hydrogen and oxygen, the first two stages burned the same kerosene/liquid oxygen propellant combination that still powers launch vehicles today, like the SpaceX Falcon 9 and the still-flying Soyuz rockets. This difference in propellant chemistry between the stages was driven by the different needs in different stages of flight: broadly speaking, early in launch thrust-to-weight ratio is more important, while combustion and thrust efficiency becomes more important for the upper stages.
