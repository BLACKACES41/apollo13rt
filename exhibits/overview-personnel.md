There are many fantastic, complete references on the various flight controllers, their roles, and the people involved. The [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/apollo-flight-controller-101-every-console-explained/) article is a great, free place to start; the book [_Go, Flight!_](http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska/9780803269378/) goes much deeper into the controllers' history throughout the early years of NASA. Here, we seek to provide enough information such that the real-time audio experience may be fully appreciated.

It is important to note that the flight controllers in the main Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) were far from the sole engineers and problem-solvers on hand during this or any other mission. There were the Staff Support Rooms (SSRs) in which internal teams backed up each flight controller, each on their own private team audio loop, as well as the Spacecraft Analysis (SPAN) room, in which engineers and other representatives from the various private contractors that actually designed and built the components of the spacecraft were on hand to offer data and analysis. In addition, there were stations all over the world, on sea and on land, which tracked the spacecraft and in doing so provided valuable information and analysis on top of the telemetry they received. Before the time of Apollo, much of this data was not networked back to Houston, and so flight controllers would actually have to be deployed to the various remote stations to directly perform their duties on-site.

Below, we review the controller positions you'll hear from most in the audio. For further information on the other equally important roles, please refer to one of the references linked above.

Flight Director (FLIGHT)
------------------------

The Flight Director was the ultimate authority during an active mission, charged with ensuring, in order, crew survival and mission success. There were actually multiple teams of flight controllers during any mission, each of which was led by its own Flight Director. You will hear from two today: Gene Kranz and Glynn Lunney. As the center of the room, both figuratively and literally, each Flight Director defined their own style of leadership and set the tone of the room. The differences between Kranz's and Lunney's styles are immediately apparent in the loop audio presented here.

One of the tools Flight had in managing their relatively sizable team was a set of manually toggled status lights, one for each flight controller. In addition to their use during go/no go calls, Flight would often call for their use as a status indicator for various critical room-wide issues, such as shift changes and status updates.

Electrical, Environmental, and Consumables Manager (EECOM)
----------------------------------------------------------

As the poor sap in charge of the electrical and cryogenic gas systems that got literally blown up during Apollo 13, EECOM is the flight controller from whom you will hear the most in the early stages of diagnosis. EECOM's purview included both electrical power and life support systems, as these systems were intertwined in their reliance upon the same cryogenic gases. These systems included gas storage and distribution, the fuel cells, batteries, alternators, and electrical buses, and the various life support and regulator valves that maintained a habitable atmosphere within the spacecraft. As implied by the name, monitoring and managing the consumption of the consumable gas (and therefore electrical) resources were also EECOM's charge.

During Kranz's shift and the initial incident, you will hear EECOM Sy Liebergot, who at one early point was described as staring at his telemetry readouts with a two-handed death grip on the handles of his display. Clint Burton takes over as part of Lunney's team&mdash;he oversees most of the power-down procedure of the CSM.

Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Systems Engineer (GNC)
---------------------------------------------------------

GNC managed all of the go-there systems: the propulsion hardware, the RCS attitude thrusters, the propellant to be burned, and the navigation instruments and software, including the guidance computer. The explosion broke many things loose, jarred many valves open or shut, and knocked electrical buses offline, and so GNC makes frequent appearances in the first hour or so following the incident to try to find a combination of RCS thrusters that are trustworthy to put on the working electrical bus, and to shut down errant thrusters which were pushing the craft about or wasting power while failing to fire.

Said appearances are made by Bill Strable, who is then relieved by Jack Kamman with Lunney's Black team.

Guidance Officer (GUIDO)
------------------------

The Guidance Officer was in charge of the spacecraft position and attitude at all times, and the appropriate use of the attitude adjustment and propulsion systems to ensure smooth operations. As an example, you will hear GUIDO crop up when the spacecraft nears gimbal lock, a condition which would invalidate all available understandings of spacecraft orientation until a lengthy recalibration could be performed. You'll also hear him talk about some of the various control modes of the spacecraft that translate crew input into thruster firings.

Bill Fenner and Ray Teague serve as White team GUIDO, while Gary Renick and Will Presley take over as part of Black team.

Flight Dynamics Officer (FDO)
-----------------------------

Down in the spirited Trench of the room, FDO managed spacecraft trajectory, both present and into the future. Where GNC and CONTROL managed the propulsion and attitude control hardware and software systems of the CSM and LM, respectively, and GUIDO was in charge of their actual, immediate use, FDO worked one level above that, formulating and overseeing the navigation and maneuver plans required to deliver the spacecraft where it needed to go. FDO collaborated with a variety of people, both on and off campus, to determine and calculate the necessary orbital maneuvers required to achive mission success.

Bill Stoval is FDO for Kranz's White team, and Bill Boone and Maurice Kennedy take over at shift change.

Integrated Communications Officer (INCO)
----------------------------------------

INCO was in change of communications for both spacecraft. These included the telemetry systems, and the various omnidirectional and steerable antennas upon each craft. In addition to managing the on-board equipment to ensure quality of signal and successful data operations, INCO worked with NETWORK and PROCEDURES to coordinate appropriate related reconfigurations of the ground-air link from both ends of the connection.

INCO pipes up quite a bit in the audio to ask for antenna changes as the spacecraft attitude is somewhat out of control following the accident; INCO is also a key player and communicator in identifying and resolving the LM/S-IVB communications issues that occur midway through the Black team shift.

The White team INCO was Alan Glines, and the Black team INCOs were Gary Scott and Ed Fendell.

Telemetry, Electrical, and EVA Mobility Unity Officer (TELMU)
-------------------------------------------------------------

TELMU was effectively the EECOM of the Lunar Module, responsible for many of the respective systems aboard the LM. As the Lunar Module lifeboat plan becomes increasingly real and correspondingly pressing, TELMU has to oversee an emergency startup of the LM, working with the crew on board to safely power up the spacecraft in literal record time. Later, TELMU is a key player in determining a low-power configuration that can bring the crew safely home while maintaining navigation.

Kranz's TELMU was Bob Heselmeyer, and Lunney's TELMU was Merlin Merritt.

Control Officer (CONTROL)
-------------------------

Where TELMU is effectively the EECOM of the Lunar Module, CONTROL is effectively the GNC. In addition to overseeing the navigation and propulsion systems during powerup and the lunar-bound correction burn following the accident, the heavy debate had by Lunney's team on maintaining platform control on a low electricity budget hinged on the navigation systems overseen by CONTROL.

During Kranz's shift, CONTROL was Larry Strimple. He was relieved by Hal Loden for Lunney's shift.

Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)
-----------------------------

CAPCOM was, with exceedingly rare exception, the only person allowed to talk directly to the crew. This allowed him to ensure the consistency, coherency, and accuracy of instructions and information transiting to and from the crew, and to translate to and from terms and descriptions more-familiar to the astronauts. The latter effort was aided by a convention that CAPCOMs were drawn from the astronaut pool.

Jack Lousma serves as CAPCOM throughout all available audio here. He later flew aboard the Skylab 3 mission, and commanded one of the very first Space Shuttle missions, STS-3.
