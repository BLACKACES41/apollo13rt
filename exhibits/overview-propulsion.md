Fundamentally, the act of traversing outer space to reach the Moon involved being able to point in a particular direction, and apply acceleration in that direction. On Apollo, this was done by the three available main engines, and the Reaction Control System.

Engines
-------

All rocket engines involve a violent chemical reaction of some kind and a way of directing the output of that reaction in a particular direction. As a consequence of this, they also involve the storage of at least two chemical propellants to react. Typically, one chemical is a fuel and the other is an oxidizer. All the engines on board the Apollo spacecraft itself involved hypergolic fuels which ignited spontaneously upon mixing. This simplified the many restart ignitions the engines would have to perform in space, but hypergolic fuels are highly hazardous and corrosive, making them difficult to handle and in some cases making it impossible to actually test the engine before launch.

The propulsion system on the Service Module (called the Service Propulsion System or SPS), the Lunar Module descent engine (called the Descent Propulsion System, DPS), and the Lunar Module ascent engine (Ascent Propulsion System, APS) all burned a fuel mixture of hydrazine and UDMH, and an oxidizer of nitrogen tetroxide. These chemicals are exactly as unpleasant as they sound, but they are stable as liquids at a variety of temperatures, which makes them low-maintenance once in orbit.

Reaction Control System
-----------------------

Of course, the spacecraft still needs to be able to orient itself in between burns. This is necessary for a variety of reasons, including communications, thermal control, and avoiding gimbal lock. This task is accomplished via the Reaction Control System (RCS), a series of small jets carefully positioned around the spacecraft to allow precise control of all three attitude axes: pitch, roll, and yaw. In addition, by selectively determining which jets to fire the RCS system could also be used to provide translational rather than rotational force&mdash;that is, it could push the spacecraft around rather than turn it. These jets used the same nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer as the main engines, but burned monomethylhydrazine (MMH) fuel instead.

Jets could be fired by the Digital Autopilot (DAP) or by manual crew input. Crew input could either (typically in relatively extreme circumstances) directly engage the solenoids to fire the thrusters, or could be filtered through various selectable input modes via the Stabilization Control System (SCS) to tailor the system to different circumstances. Min Impulse mode, for instance, would fire each jet only once for a 15 millisecond burst each time the stick was pushed.

Ultimately, whether by DAP, SCS, or Direct engagement, the jets were fired by engaging electric solenoids in each propellant feed line that allowed the pressurized propellants to mix and react. Heaters on the lines kept the chemicals from freezing and warmed them to an optimum temperature for reaction.

Mission Profile
---------------

{{figure:burn-profile}}

An Apollo mission involved quite a few precision burns. Following launch, the biggest ones were Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI), which brought the spacecraft from a largely circular Earth orbit into a highly elliptical orbit which could reach the Moon, Lunar Orbit Injection (LOI), which recircularized the orbit around the Moon once the spacecraft arrived, and Trans-Earth Injection (TEI), which was the inverse of Trans-Lunar Injection, bringing the spacecraft home.

However, a number of midcourse correction burns (MCCs) were also important, correcting errors in the orbit at predetermined times on the way to and from the Moon. As many as seven midcourse corrections would be executed as necessary. Sometimes they were omitted, and sometimes the required &Delta;V was small enough to be simply carried out by the RCS system rather than the SPS.

Anatomy of a Burn
-----------------

{{figure:pad}}

Trajectories and burns would be calculated on mainframes on the ground based on tracking data, and the relevant figures would be transmitted to Mission Control and then to the crew in space in a format called a PAD. The PAD would include, amongst other things, time of burn, attitude, and duration. Prior to a burn, the crew would fine-align the platform with a P52, and run through a checklist of tasks to power up and prepare the various systems needed for the burn.

Just before ignition, the RCS system would fire to push the spacecraft forward and thus the propellants to the back of the tank where the feed lines were; this was known as ullage and could be performed automatically by the computer. In fact, the burn itself was typically performed by the computer, and many of the PAD figures were provided for the purpose of computer input via the DSKY.

After completion of the burn, the spacecraft's tracking and telemetry would be evaluated, and based on the resulting residual errors the crew would sometimes be asked to perform a trim, a small additional adjustment to account for any small errors in the burn process. A checklist would then be followed to power everything back down again, realign the platform with a star check yet again, and resume normal spacecraft operation.

This entire process was typically scheduled to take around two hours.
