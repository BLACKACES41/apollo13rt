Go ahead.

[- 55 49 12] CAPCOM

And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -

Okay. Will do.

One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.

[55 49 25 - 55 50 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

Okay. Your SECONDARY RAD IN, I gave to you 70 - about 72 degrees; the RAD OUT is about 30; the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP is reading about 65; STEAM PRESSURE full scale high, GLYCOL DISCHARGE PRESSURE about 9 psi. The ACCUM - SECONDARY ACCUMULATOR is about 30 - 34 percent.

[56 54 01 - 56 54 19] LMP
Our temperatures: SUITS showing about 52 degrees; CABIN about 58 degrees; pressures, SUIT reading 4.1, CABIN at 5. PARTIAL PRESSURE CO2 is up to a little over 1, about 1.1.

[56 54 21 - 56 54 47] LMP
On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72 degrees, helium's reading 3500; N2 A is reading 2300; N2 B about 2450. And our ullage pressures: FUEL is reading about 165; OXIDIZER 170.

[56 54 52 - 56 55 32] LMP
Fuel cells: FUEL CELL 1, both CLOSED, they're zip; SKIN TEMP 405 degrees; CONDENSE EXHAUST is lower scale. FUEL CELL 2 - right now we've got an O2 - an H2 FLOW reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O2 FLOW is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also {given us MAIN BUS A undervolts} from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high.
1> As thrusters used power when they fired and each load drops the voltage, the thrusters could trigger undervolt warnings when they engaged.

[56 55 34 - 56 56 03] LMP
The T-SKIN is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17, correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: FUEL CELL 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48, again depending on thruster activity.

[56 56 04] CAPCOM
