Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.

Thank you, 13.

Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -

Go ahead.

[- 55 49 12] CAPCOM
- we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -

[55 49 12] CMP
Okay. Will do.

[55 49 14 - 55 49 21] CAPCOM
One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.

[55 49 25 - 55 50 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

[55 50 05 - 55 50 09] CAPCOM
Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.

Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it.

[55 56 09 - 55 56 32] LMP
Okay. Right now, Houston the voltage is looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there. And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had an amp spike on it once before.
