Go ahead.

Okay. Will do.

One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.

[55 49 25 - 55 50 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

- my last copy is SECONDARY RAD IN.

[56 53 28 - 56 53 59] LMP
Okay. Your SECONDARY RAD IN, I gave to you 70 - about 72 degrees; the RAD OUT is about 30; the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP is reading about 65; STEAM PRESSURE full scale high, GLYCOL DISCHARGE PRESSURE about 9 psi. The ACCUM - SECONDARY ACCUMULATOR is about 30 - 34 percent.

[56 54 01 - 56 54 19] LMP
Our temperatures: SUITS showing about 52 degrees; CABIN about 58 degrees; pressures, SUIT reading 4.1, CABIN at 5. PARTIAL PRESSURE CO2 is up to a little over 1, about 1.1.

[56 54 21 - 56 54 47] LMP
On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72 degrees, helium's reading 3500; N2 A is reading 2300; N2 B about 2450. And our ullage pressures: FUEL is reading about 165; OXIDIZER 170.

[56 54 52 - 56 55 32] LMP
Fuel cells: FUEL CELL 1, both CLOSED, they're zip; SKIN TEMP 405 degrees; CONDENSE EXHAUST is lower scale. FUEL CELL 2 - right now we've got an O2 - an H2 FLOW reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O2 FLOW is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also {given us MAIN BUS A undervolts} from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high.
1> As thrusters used power when they fired and each load drops the voltage, the thrusters could trigger undervolt warnings when they engaged.

[56 55 34 - 56 56 03] LMP
The T-SKIN is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17, correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: FUEL CELL 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48, again depending on thruster activity.

[56 56 04] CAPCOM
Standby.

[56 56 05 - 56 56 09] LMP
- is 0 amps. Say again, Jack?

Houston, 13.

[56 56 56 - 56 56 59] LMP
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. How do you read?

[56 57 08 - 56 57 21] CAPCOM
Okay, 13. This is Houston. It apears to us that we're losing O2 flow through FUEL CELL 3. So, we want you to close the REAC valve on FUEL CELL 3. It looks like FUEL CELL 1 and 2 are trying to hold up okay. You copy?

[56 57 26 - 56 57 39] LMP
Are you saying FUEL CELL 1 and 2 - 1 and 2 are trying to hold up but we're leaking O2 out of FUEL CELL 3? And you want me to shut the REAC valve on FUEL CELL 3? Did I hear you right?

[56 57 41 - 56 57 44] CAPCOM
That's affirmative. Close the REAC valve on FUEL CELL 3.

[56 57 48 - 56 57 55] LMP
Okay. I'll go to the SSR page. Do you want me to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown? Is that correct?

[56 57 58] CAPCOM
Standby.

[56 58 25 - 56 58 37] CAPCOM
Okay, 13. We want you to turn the inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1. Then we want you to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on FUEL CELL 3. Read back.

[56 58 40 - 56 58 49] CMP
Okay. Shut down the inline heater on FUEL CELL 1. We're proceeding with the shutdown, special subroutine, for FUEL CELL 3.

[56 58 51] CAPCOM
That's affirmative.

[56 59 13 - 56 59 14] CAPCOM
13. OMNI Bravo, please.

[56 59 55 - 56 59 56] CAPCOM
13, Houston. Over.

[56 59 59] CMP
Go ahead.

[57 00 00 - 57 00 06] CAPCOM
Okay. You got OMNI Bravo and we'd like to have you verify that the tape recorder is OFF please.

[57 00 08] CMP
That's affirm.

[57 00 11 - 57 00 22] CMP
Okay, Jack. I'm sitting here with an 06 18 showing and I can't get rid of it. Oh, stand by just a -

[57 00 49 - 57 00 51] CDR
Okay. FUEL CELL 3 REACs are OFF, Houston.

[57 00 53] CAPCOM
Roger, Jim. Thank you.

[57 01 55 - 57 02 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. Step 2, special subroutine 1 for the fuel cell procedure has been completed.

[57 02 02] CAPCOM
Roger, thank you.

[57 04 31 - 57 04 46] CMP
Okay, Jack. I'd like to bring on jet A-4. I've got null on negative pitch control, and - negative pitch control, and right now neither DIRECT or AUTO coils.

[57 04 48 - 57 04 51] CAPCOM
Okay. You say no pitch in either DIRECT or AUTO? You want to bring on A-4?

[57 04 54 - 57 04 58] CMP
Yeah, I've got a positive pitch rate and I can't stop it.

[57 04 59] CAPCOM
Okay.

[57 05 09 - 57 05 12] CAPCOM
Okay, Jack. Bring A-4 on. Stop the pitch rate.

[57 05 16] CMP
Okay. That got it.

[57 05 37 - 57 05 39] CAPCOM
And 13, we need OMNI Charlie, please.

[57 05 42 - 57 05 43] LMP
OMNI Charlie.

[57 05 47 - 57 05 52] CAPCOM
And Freddo, we would like to have you verify fuel cell reactants talkback is barber pole.

[57 05 55 - 57 06 00] LMP
That's affirm. I watched it and it went barber pole as I threw the switch.

[57 06 02] CAPCOM
Roger.
