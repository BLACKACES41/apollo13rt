Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.

[55 46 30] CAPCOM
Thank you, 13.

[55 48 40 -] CAPCOM
Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -

[55 48 45] CMP
Go ahead.

[- 55 48 12] CAPCOM
- we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify -

[55 49 12] CMP
Okay. Will do.

[55 49 14 - 55 49 21] CAPCOM
One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.

[55 49 25 - 55 50 00] CMP
Okay, Jack. During the TV we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

[55 50 05 - 55 50 09] CAPCOM
Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.

[55 50 12 - 55 50 19] CMP
Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0.

[55 50 31 - 55 50 33] CAPCOM
And 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.

[55 51 32 - 55 51 35] CMP
Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated on battery B.

[55 51 36 - 55 51 49] CAPCOM
Roger. We see it, Jack. And we've got a reading of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd like to know if that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.

[55 51 52 - 55 51 55] CMP
No. It's minus 2.0 precisely.

[55 51 56] CAPCOM
Thank you.

[55 52 57 -] CAPCOM
13, we've got one more item for you, when you get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion -

[55 53 05] CMP
Okay.

[- 55 53 07] CAPCOM
- for looking at Comet Bennett, if you need it.

[55 53 09] CMP
Okay. Standby.

[55 55 19] LMP
Okay, Houston -

[55 55 20 - 55 55 21] CDR
I believe we've had a problem here.

[55 55 28 - 55 55 29] CAPCOM
This is Houston. Say again, please.

[55 55 35 - 55 55 40] CDR
{Houston, we've had a problem.} {We've had a MAIN B BUS UNDERVOLT.}
1> Not "we have a problem," as in the film. The scriptwriters felt the present tense was more appropriate.
2> The first reading that the MAIN B electrical bus was dead: it is below the expected voltage.

[55 55 42] CAPCOM
Roger. MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

[55 55 57 - 55 55 59] CAPCOM
Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it.

[55 56 09 - 55 56 32] LMP
Okay. Right now, Houston the voltage is looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there. And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had an amp spike on it once before.

[55 56 40] CAPCOM
Roger, Fred.

[55 56 54 - 55 56 57] LMP
In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again.

[55 57 00] CAPCOM
Roger.

[55 57 04 - 55 57 17] LMP
Yes. That jolt must have rocked the sensor on - I see now - O2 QUANTITY 2; it was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's full-scale high again.

[55 57 20] CAPCOM
Roger.

[55 57 29 - 55 57 35] CDR
And Houston, we had a RESTART on our computer. We have PGNCS light and RESTART RESET.

[55 57 37 - 55 57 42] CAPCOM
Roger. RESTART and a PGNCS light. RESET on a PNGCS, RESET -

[55 57 42 - 55 58 04] CDR
And now looking at our SERVICE MODULE RCS HELIUM 1, we have B is barber poled and D is barber poled. HELIUM 2, D is barber pole. And SECONDARY PROPELLANTS I have A and C barber pole. BMAG temperatures?

[55 58 07 - 55 58 11] LMP
Okay, AC 2 is showing zip. I'm going to try to reconfigure on that, Jack.

[55 58 12] CAPCOM
Roger.

[55 58 25 - 55 58 28] LMP
We got a MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT now too, showing.

[55 58 29] CAPCOM
MAIN A UNDERVOLT.

[55 58 32 - 55 58 37] LMP
It's reading about 25 and a half. MAIN B is reading zip right now.

[55 59 33] CDR
And Houston, Odyssey.

[55 59 38] CAPCOM
Standby 1, Jim.

[56 00 34 - 56 00 44] CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell 1 to MAIN A and fuel cell 3 to MAIN B. Verify quad Delta is open.

[56 00 53 - 56 01 04] LMP
Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both showing grey flags, but they're both showing zip on the flows.

[56 01 07] CAPCOM
We copy.

[56 03 17 - 56 03 19] LMP
Okay, Houston. Are you still reading - 13?

[56 03 20 - 56 03 26] CAPCOM
That's affirmative, we're reading you. We're trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.

[56 03 29 - 56 03 36] LMP
Okay. Let me give you some readings - in the interim to help MAIN A voltage, Jack. I've got BUS TIE AC on.

[56 03 37] CAPCOM
Say again, Fred.

[56 03 42 - 56 03 51] LMP
In the interim, to help out MAIN A voltage, I've got MAIN BUS TIE BAT AC on. Or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on MAIN A?

[56 03 52] CAPCOM
Okay. BUS TIE AC on.

[56 04 09] CAPCOM
13, Houston. We need OMNI Charlie, please.

[56 04 19] LMP
You got it.

[56 05 32 - 56 05 42] CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. We would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. We need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2.

[56 05 46 - 56 05 50] LMP
Okay. Nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. Is that correct?

[56 05 50 - 56 05 52] CAPCOM
Negative. Oxygen on 3.

[56 05 54] LMP
Okay.

[56 05 24 - 56 05 28] LMP
Okay. The systems test 1-A says zip.

[56 06 43 - 56 06 48] LMP
And 2 Baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6.

[56 06 50 - 56 06 53] CAPCOM
2 Baker says 0.6, and say again the other one.

[56 06 57 - 56 07 00] LMP
Fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero.

[56 07 01] CAPCOM
Roger, zero.

[56 08 46 - 56 08 52] CAPCOM
13, Houston. We'd like you to open-circuit fuel cell 1. Leave 2 and 3 as-is.

[56 08 55 - 56 08 56] LMP
Okay. I'll get to work on that.

[56 08 57 - 56 09 03] CDR
And Jack, our O2 QUANTITY number 2 tank is reading zero. Did you get that?

[56 09 04 - 56 09 06] CAPCOM
O2 QUANTITY number 2 is zero.

[56 09 07 - 56 09 21] CDR
That's AC, okay. Yeah, that's (unintelligible) AC and it looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the - into space.
> In the film, the whole timeline is compressed - including this call nearly 14 minutes following the incident.

[56 09 22] CAPCOM
Roger. We copy your venting.

[56 09 28] CDR
It's a gas of some sort.

[56 09 49 - 56 09 52] LMP
Okay, fuel cell 1 you just wanted it off the line now, Jack, is that right?

[56 09 52 - 56 09 55] CAPCOM
We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.

[56 09 58 - 56 09 59] LMP
Okay, she's off the line.

[56 12 48 - 56 13 02] CAPCOM
13, Houston. We see you getting close to gimbal lock there. We'd like you to bring up all quad Cs on MAIN A, quad C-l, C-2, C-3, C-4 on MAIN A, and also bring B-3 and B-4 up on MAIN A.

[56 13 15 - 56 13 16] CAPCOM
13, Houston. Do you read?

[56 13 20] LMP
Yes. No, we got it.

[56 13 21] CDR
Affirm.

[56 13 22 - 56 13 27] CAPCOM
Okay. Can you tell us anything about the venting: where it's coming from, what window you see it at?

[56 13 30 - 56 13 34] LMP
It's coming out of window 1 right now, Jack, and could you give me the thrusters again?

[56 13 36 -] CAPCOM
Okay, the thrusters -

[56 13 37] LMP
What buses?

[- 56 13 48] CAPCOM
We'd like - on MAIN A, we'd like Charlie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also Bravo 3 and 4 on MAIN A.

[56 13 52] LMP
Okay. Got it.
