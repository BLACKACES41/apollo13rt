[55 46 46 -] CAPCOM
Okay FLIGHT, you read his pitch and yaw and his high-gain ??.

[55 46 50 - 55 46 52] FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

[- 55 46 55] CAPCOM
And now you want roll right to 060?

[55 46 56 - 55 47 08] FLIGHT
Might as well do that. And we're trying Comet Bennett, I'd still like the verification on the docking angle because that's what we'll be using for computation for alignments and everything else. Let's see if there's anything else.

[55 47 08] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 47 09] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[55 47 10 - ] EECOM
Okay, let's terminate battery B charge at 55 plus 50.

[55 47 14] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 55 47 20] EECOM
And at the same time, I'd sure like to have a cryo stir, all four tanks.

[55 47 20 - 55 47 22] FLIGHT
Let's wait until they get settled down a little more.

[55 47 22] EECOM
Roger.

[55 47 23 -] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 47 24] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[ - 55 47 28] GNC
?? would still like to enable the other two quads for the maneuver.

[55 48 29 - 55 47 35] FLIGHT
Okay. When rolling to 060 you want them to enable C and D, right?

[55 47 35] GNC
Right.

[55 47 36 - 55 47 38] FLIGHT
Do you want them to disable A and B?

[55 47 38] GNC
No.

[455 47 38 - 55 47 40] FLIGHT
Okay. All four quads.

[55 47 40] GNC
They have a couple of jet maneuvers -

[55 47 42 - 55 47 44] FLIGHT
Roger. Copy, CAPCOM?

[55 47 44] CAPCOM
Got it.

[55 47 46] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[55 47 47] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[55 47 47 -] INCO
I'd like to confirm their configuration on their high-gain now.

[55 47 50] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 55 47 56] INCO
I'd like to know what track mode they're in and what SERVO electronics they're in.

[55 47 56 - 55 48 04] FLIGHT
Okay, let's just standby 1 there. Now we'll C and D for roll to 060, terminate battery B charge.

[55 48 10 - 55 48 25] FLIGHT
Okay, the third thing we want up there, CAPCOM is to verify their high-gain configuration. And I assume what you want from there is you want to know their tracking, position of track - beam width you don't need, do you? Do you want the whole works?

[55 48 25] INCO
Yeah, the whole works.

[55 48 25] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 48 31 - 55 48 35] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, we want the configuration of the CSM high-gain.

[55 49 34] INCO
That's good.

[55 49 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 04] INCO??
Good report.

[55 50 09] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 50 10] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[55 50 11 - 55 50 14] GNC
Can we verify that they reenabled C-4 thruster?

[55 50 20 - 55 50 23] FLIGHT
Okay. Verify that they re- - you're showing that disabled, yes?

[55 50 23] GNC
Yes.

[55 50 24 - 55 50 27] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, restore CM C-4 thruster; disabled.

[55 50 33] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 50 34] FLIGHT
Go EECOM.

[55 50 34 - 55 50 36] EECOM
You've got 40 amp-hours back in battery B now.

[55 50 37] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 42] EECOM??
You got it, FLIGHT.
> Possibly in response to seeing BAT B charge disabled.

[55 50 43] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 50 54 -] FLIGHT
Okay, all flight controllers. I want to go around the horn and pick up anything you need configuration-wise. TELMU -

[55 51 00] TELMU
Go ahead, FLIGHT.

[ - 55 51 04] FLIGHT
- you still worried about any configuration items?

[55 51 06 - 55 51 14] TELMU
Negative. The LM heater current indicates that the level?? was properly closed out. They apparently have not closed the LM hatch yet.

[55 51 14 - 55 51 21] FLIGHT
Okay. So you're happy that you don't need them to verify that - what was it, activation 2-3, those pages we were on?

[55 51 21 - 55 51 23] TELMU
That's right. That was TLC 2, and we're happy.

[55 51 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 51 27] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 51 29] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 51 30 - 55 51 32] GUIDO
Can we ask about the docking index again?

[55 51 33 - 55 51 35] FLIGHT
CAPCOM will get that for me.

[55 51 55 - 55 51 57] FLIGHT
Okay. Got your answer, GUIDANCE?

[55 51 57] GUIDO
Roger, FLIGHT.

[55 51 58 - 55 52 00] FLIGHT
Okay, go with it.

[55 52 31 - 55 52 34] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you got any configuration items here?

[55 52 35] GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

[55 52 37 - 55 52 43] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, looks like the last item we need here is a stir on H2 and O2 at their convenience.
> The fateful but inevitable request.

[55 52 44] CAPCOM
Okay.

[55 53 55] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 53 59] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 00 - 55 54 07] GUIDO
We finally got a âˆ†H update. Do you want to just read it up to the crew or just uplink it?

[55 54 08 - 55 54 13] FLIGHT
Let's see. Can we collapse deadbands and do all that good stuff if we uplink here?

[55 54 18 - 55 54 22] GUIDO
Uh. Yeah. Why don't we just read it up to them?

[55 54 23 - 55 54 25] FLIGHT
If they enter it through the DSKY are they gonna do it? ??

[55 54 26] GUIDO
Standby 1.

[55 54 30 - 55 54 34] FLIGHT
{Now, we have them stable out at that attitude yet}, so I don't think we're gonna have any problems.
1> ??

[55 54 34 - 55 54 36] INCO??
FLIGHT, I don't think there's any problem, they haven't opened up deadbands yet.

[55 54 37 - 55 54 41] FLIGHT
Yeah, that's just what I'm saying. The time to do it is now, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 41] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 42] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 54 43 - 55 54 54] GUIDO
As long as he's in P00 and don't reselect it, he can uplink it - enter it himself or we can do it easier??. Doesn't matter.

[55 54 57 -] FLIGHT
Okay. Why don't - you gotta pass the data for the crew checklist anyway on-board, don't you?

[55 55 04] GUIDO
Right.

[- 55 55 08] FLIGHT
Don't you have page update? Well, why don't we read it up to them and that'll serve both purposes.

[55 55 10] GUIDO
Alright.

[55 55 10 - 55 55 14] FLIGHT
Both have them enter it as well as why don't you tell them what page you want it in the checklist?

[55 55 15] GUIDO
Okay.

[55 55 18] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[55 55 18] FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

[55 55 19 - 55 55 23] TELMU
We show the LM overhead hatch is closed, and the heater current looks normal.

[55 55 23] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 55 26] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[55 55 27] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[55 55 27 - 55 55 29] GUIDO
We've had a hardware restart. I don't know what it was.

[55 55 29 - 55 55 35] FLIGHT
Okay. GNC, you want to look at it? See if you see any problems?

[55 55 37 - 55 55 39] FLIGHT
Roger. We're copying it, CAPCOM. We see a hardware restart.

[55 55 41 - 55 55 44] FLIGHT
You see an AC BUS UNDERVOLT there, GUIDANCE? Err - EECOM?

[55 55 46] EECOM
Negative, FLIGHT.

[55 55 48 - 55 55 49] FLIGHT
I believe the crew reported it.

[55 55 50 - 55 55 51] CAPCOM
We've got a MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

[55 55 51 - 55 55 54] EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got some instrumentation funnies, let me add them up.
> Having missed the pre-explosion pressure spike on tank 2, all EECOM has to work with now is a Christmas tree of bad data readout. So many numbers were off whack all of a sudden that EECOM assumes it has to be instrumentation. Lengthy discussion ensues on the EECOM loop (available audio track).
> Poor Sy had a "two-handed deathgrip" on his console by now.[ref2 p210]

[55 55 54] FLIGHT
Roger.

[55 56 00 - 55 56 02] EECOM
We may have had an instrumentation problem, FLIGHT.

[55 56 03] FLIGHT
Roger.

[55 56 07] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[55 56 08] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[55 56 09 - 55 56 11] INCO
We switched to WIDE BEAM about the time we had the problem.
> A red herring.

[55 56 33] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 56 42 - 55 56 44] FLIGHT
INCO, you say you went to wide beam with that?

[55 56 44] INCO
Yes.

[55 56 48 - 55 56 53] FLIGHT
Let's see if we can correlate those times. Get the time when you went wide beam, INCO.

[55 56 55] INCO
Okay.

[55 57 02 - 55 57 03] CAPCOM
Do we have the floodlights off right now?

[55 57 04] TELMU??
That's affirmative, FLIGHT.

[55 57 05 - 55 57 08] FLIGHT
Yeah, we can determine that from the LM current.

[55 57 37] FLIGHT
Roger, we copy that also.

[55 58 13 -] FLIGHT
EECOM, you see any AC problems? Looks like -

[55 58 15] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[- 55 58 17] FLIGHT
we have a lot of instrumentation problems here. Go ahead.

[55 58 18 - 55 58 22] EECOM
That's affirm. {He's flipping the fuel cells around, FLIGHT.}
1> This ended up being a problem for the flight controllers. The astronauts were doing their own problem solving and configuration changes, so every time the controllers on the ground had a recommendation for them something would get changed and they'd have to start over.[ref2 p212]

[55 58 23 - 55 58 26] FLIGHT
Well, let's get some recommendation here, Sy, if you've got any better ideas.

[55 58 32 - 55 58 34] FLIGHT
Sy, what do you want to do? Hold your own, and -

[55 58 40 - 55 58 43] FLIGHT
- Sy, have you got a SIG SENSOR type problem there, or what?

[55 58 43] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[55 58 44] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[55 58 45 - 55 59 01] EECOM
He's got fuel cells 1 and 3 are offline. We've got MAIN A volts, we have no MAIN B volts. Have them attempt to reconnect the fuel cells. FUEL CELL 1 to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.

[55 59 02 -] FLIGHT
Okay.

[55 59 03 -] EECOM
We just gotta -

[ - ] FLIGHT
FUEL CELL 1 -

[ - 55 59 07] EECOM
- back to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 back to MAIN B.

[- 55 59 10] FLIGHT
- MAIN A, 3 to MAIN B.

[55 59 10] EECOM
Let's see what happens.

[55 59 11 - 55 59 14] FLIGHT
Okay, now is there - do we have instrumentation problems?

[55 59 16 -] EECOM
Well, we've lost - it does appear we've lost AC BUS 2 VOLTAGE. MAIN B is reading - 4 VOLTS. And that effectively takes AC 2 away from us -

[55 59 29] FLIGHT
Okay.

[ - ] EECOM
- the - yeah and he reported barber poles on the -

[55 59 35] FLIGHT
Roger.

[ - 55 59 36] EECOM
- on the fuel cell on-board, too, FLIGHT.

[55 59 36] FLIGHT
(unintelligible) yeah.

[55 59 38] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[55 59 39] EECOM
Let's see if we can get our DC back.

[55 59 40] FLIGHT
Roger. Go ahead, GNC.

[55 59 41 - 55 59 43] GNC
Verify that the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVES are open.

[55 59 46 - 55 59 51] FLIGHT
You seeing an attitude problem or you seeing some BI-levels that are giving you problems?

[55 59 51 - 55 59 59] GNC
No, it's some low pressures in the fuel and oxidizer which would be symptomatic of the {HELIUM VALVE closing and firing some jets.}
1> Here he means these two things both happening, not that the valve closing would cause jet firing. Helium is used as an inert gas to maintain pressure in many propellant tanks even today. If the helium isn't coming in, propellant gas exits the tank without anything re-entering to keep the pressure up.
> Kranz notes[ref1 p312] that this was a moment of realization for him; the reported bang must have been pretty strong to have jarred shut the valve. He'd seen something similar on Apollo 9 during CSM/S-IVB separation.

[55 59 59 - 56 00 01] FLIGHT
Quad number 2 HELIUM VALVE open?

[56 00 01] GNC
Quad Delta.

[56 00 02 - 56 00 05] FLIGHT
Quad Delta - HELIUM VALVE open, right?

[56 00 05] GNC
Right.

[56 00 10 - 56 00 15] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, do you want to verify quad Delta HELIUM VALVE is open, please.

[56 00 16 - 56 00 18] FLIGHT
Are there other problems in the RCS?

[56 00 20 - 56 00 24] CAPCOM
Okay, is that all we've come up with for them; have we got any other recommendations?

[56 00 25 - 56 00 331] FLIGHT
Yeah, we wanted to get FUEL CELL 1 configured to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B. Did you pass that up?

[56 00 32] EECOM
Let's attempt that, FLIGHT.

[56 00 37 - 56 00 42] FLIGHT
INCO, this seems to be an AC type problem, it may be tied into that high-gain thing you got.

[56 00 45 - 56 00 49] INCO
We went to WIDE BEAM with ?? at 55 55 04, best we can tell.

[56 00 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 01 06] EECOM
I copy, FLIGHT.

[56 01 09 - 56 01 13] EECOM
Let me commiserate on that.

[56 01 16 - 56 01 20] CAPCOM
Is there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation or have we got a real problem, or what?
> The lack of answer here is telling. At some point here, steely-eyed missile man and NASA legend EECOM John Aaron had gotten called at home. He asked for some numbers to be read out, and while bolting out the door warned them that whatever it was, it _wasn't_ instrumentation.[ref2 p213]

[56 01 34] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 01 35] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 01 36 - 56 01 38] EECOM
Let's reverse the configuration request -

[56 01 38 - 56 01 44] FLIGHT
Okay, now wait a minute. We've got a good MAIN A BUS, let's make sure that whatever we do doesn't screw up MAIN A. MAIN A -

[56 01 43 -] EECOM
FUEL CELL 2 is on MAIN A, FLIGHT -

[56 01 45] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 01 47] EECOM
- and I'm not going to ask to change that.

[56 01 47] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do?

[56 01 48 - 56 01 55] EECOM
Let's try to put FUEL CELL 1 on MAIN B, FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A. We'll use the other sensing circuitry.

[56 01 57 - 56 02 00] FLIGHT
FUEL CELL number 1 on MAIN B -

[56 02 00] EECOM
- FUEL CELL 3 on main A.

[56 02 09 - 56 02 11] EECOM
We're not going to touch FUEL CELL 2, FLIGHT.

[56 02 12 - 56 02 22] FLIGHT
Okay, but if we got any problems in the system I want to make sure that we don't blow the voltage off MAIN A, then we're not going to be able to see anything.

[56 02 28 - 56 02 35] FLIGHT
Can we review our status here, Sy, and see what we've got from a standpoint of status. What do you think we've got in the spacecraft that's good?

[56 02 35 - 56 02 37] EECOM
MAIN BUS A is reading 25 volts.

[56 02 38] FLIGHT
Okay. MAIN A -

[56 02 39 - 56 02 48] EECOM
And that's reflected by the fact - FUEL CELL 2 is putting out 53 amps, which is just about the most it can and keep our voltage up.

[56 02 48] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 02 48 - 56 02 54] EECOM
So that's bona fide. AC BUS 2 is zero, which is reflected by the fact that we lost MAIN B.

[56 02 55 - 56 02 57] FLIGHT
AC BUS -

[56 02 59] EECOM
Standby, FLIGHT.

[56 03 03] FLIGHT
- zero output.

[56 03 07] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 03 13] FLIGHT
Go ahead, EECOM.

[56 03 14 - 56 03 25] EECOM
Okay. If we want to keep - - standby, he's changing configuration, we've got BATTERY A on MAIN A.

[56 03 27] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 03 27 - 56 03 29] EECOM
?? was going to ask you for the battery on, FLIGHT.

[56 03 30] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[56 03 31] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[56 03 31 - 56 03 36] INCO
We need OMNI Bravo. Our high-gain won't drive without AC 2.

[56 03 37 - 56 03 39] FLIGHT
Okay. You want OMNI Bravo?

[56 03 39] INCO
Right.

[56 03 48 - 56 03 53] FLIGHT
You don't think we're going to be able to get high-bitrate data here, do you? On the OMNIs.

[56 03 53] INCO
Well, maybe. We've got the 210s.

[56 03 54 -] FLIGHT
You've got the 210s -

[56 03 56] INCO
Correct.

[ - ] FLIGHT
Okay, that'll save a bit of power. CAPCOM, recommend selection of OMNI Bravo, please -

[56 04 01] INCO
It's Charlie now.

[- 56 04 03] FLIGHT
Okay, Charlie.

[56 04 03] INCO
He's maneuvering.

[56 04 05] CAPCOM
OMNI Charlie?

[56 04 06] FLIGHT
That's affirmative.

[56 04 06] INCO
Roger.

[56 04 27 - 56 04 30] INCO
Okay, FLIGHT, we've got OMNI Charlie and high-bitrate.

[56 04 31 -] FLIGHT
Okay. You have high-bitrate now off the 210s, right? OMNI -

[56 04 34] INCO
Right.

[- 56 04 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[65 04 58] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 04 59] FLIGHT
Go, EECOM.

[56 05 00 -] EECOM
Okay. Let's get readout on a couple of fuel cell pressures here -

[56 05 04] FLIGHT
Okay.

[- 56 05 17] EECOM
- FUEL CELL 1 N2 pressure. FUEL CELL 3 O2 pressure. We're reading zero {N2 pressure} on FUEL CELL 1 and 13psi on FUEL CELL 3 O2 pressure.
1> Nitrogen was used to pressurize the electrolytes in the fuel cell through a diaphragm. Feedback loops are set up with the cryogenic oxygen to regulate the relative pressures.

[56 05 19 -] FLIGHT
Okay, you want FUEL CELL 1 -

[56 05 21] EECOM
N2 pressure.

[ - 56 05 25] FLIGHT
- N2 pressure. FUEL CELL 3, what do you want there?

[56 05 26] EECOM
O2 pressure.

[56 05 26 - 56 05 30] FLIGHT
O2 pressure. CAPCOM, let's get those as a start.

[56 05 33] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[56 05 34] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[56 05 35 - 56 05 45] GUIDO
When his hardware restart he was doing a clearly fine maneuver ??, and that should have killed it, but we're still moving. We ought to stop it.

[56 05 45] FLIGHT
Are we using RCS now, Buck?

[56 05 58] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 06 01] FLIGHT
GNC, from FLIGHT.

[56 06 04] GNC
GNC.

[56 06 04 - 56 06 08] FLIGHT
Did you see any problems in quad D HELIUM VALVE? Does that look like that's cleared up?

[56 06 08 - 56 06 10] GNC
Roger, that's cleared up, FLIGHT, we're in good shape.

[56 06 10 - 56 06 12] FLIGHT
Okay. Now, are we using RCS now?

[56 06 12 - 56 06 16] GNC
That's affirmative, we're going to have to switch some thrusters to MAIN A to hold attitude here.

[56 06 17 - 56 06 21] FLIGHT
Okay. How much RCS are we using?

[56 06 22 - 56 06 25] GNC
Oh, we've used - our guess 25 pounds.

[56 06 27 - 56 06 31] FLIGHT
Okay. Give me minimum fuel usage configuration that'll keep me attitude.

[56 06 32] GNC
Roger.

[56 06 33] TELMU
FLIGHT, TELMU.

[56 06 34] FLIGHT
Go, TELMU.

[56 06 34 - 56 06 37] TELMU
The LM heater current's become essentially static.

[56 06 38 - 56 06 42] FLIGHT
Roger. Let's solve one problem at a time. Come back to me later on on it.o

[56 07 05] CAPCOM
We confirming those numbers?

[56 07 20 - 56 07 22] FLIGHT
Buck [GNC], I need that RCS stuff as soon as you can get it.

[56 07 22 - 56 07 24] GNC
Roger, Flight. He's turned off all jets now.

[56 07 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 07 26 - 56 07 27] CAPCOM
Okay, we came up with those numbers, FLIGHT.

[56 07 29 - 56 07 34] FLIGHT
Okay, Sy. Give me your next best thing to try.

[56 07 46] FLIGHT
EECOM, FLIGHT.

[56 07 47] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 07 47] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[56 07 51 - 56 08 04] EECOM
Why don't we try - leave FUEL CELL 2 alone, and just make sure that 1 and 3 are {disconnected from both buses.} And make sure that there's abs - {that there won't be any load on them at all.} And let's see what happens to those cells.
1> n.b. this is shutting off the _output_ electrical circuit of the fuel cells, _not_ the fuel cells themselves, which remain on.
2> Since the fuel cell electricity was produced via a chemical reaction, reducing the electrical output load would reduce the reaction rate, which could have an impact on the problem.

[56 08 06 - 56 08 09] FLIGHT
Okay, what do you want to do? Open-circuit FUEL CELL 1 and 3?

[56 08 09] EECOM
That's affirm, flight.

[56 08 10 - 56 08 20] FLIGHT
Okay. CAPCOM, let's recommend we open-circuit FUEL CELL NUMBER 1 and number 3 and leave FUEL CELL NUMBER 2 as-is.

[56 08 21 - 56 08 29] CAPCOM
Okay, 1 and 3 open-circuit, 2 as-is. And earlier we got a report from them that 1 and 3 were reading {grey} but zero flow.
1> Connected to the circuit. An open circuit would yield a barber pole.

[56 08 29 - 56 08 32] FLIGHT
Yeah - CAPCOM, let's amend that. EECOM, from FLIGHT.

[56 08 32] EECOM
FLIGHT, EECOM.

[56 08 33 -] FLIGHT
Why don't we just open-circuit 1 and make sure we don't have any problems getting that back onto the bus -

[56 08 07] EECOM
Okay, FLIGHT.

[- 56 08 40] FLIGHT
- and just watch it for a while before we make any further moves with 3.
> FLIGHT's caution is probably well-advised here, but the last-minute change is dropped by EECOM; later he thinks both 1 and 3 have been open-circuited.

[56 08 41] EECOM
Roger.

[56 08 41 - 56 08 44] FLIGHT
Okay, CAPCOM. Let's just open-circuit one of those right now.

[56 08 57] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 09 05 - 56 09 07] EECOM
That's roger, FLIGHT. That's the AC problem.

[56 09 09] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 09 16] FLIGHT
Crew thinks they're venting something.

[56 09 17] EECOM??
I heard it, FLIGHT.

[56 09 27] CAPCOM
Copy that, FLIGHT?
> Pretty much as worked-up as the room gets.

[56 09 29] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 09 33 - 56 09 38] FLIGHT
Okay, let's everybody think of the kinds of things that we'd be venting. GNC, you got anything abnormal in your system?

[56 09 39] GNC
Negative, FLIGHT.

[56 09 42 - 56 09 47] FLIGHT
How about you, EECOM? You see anything that - with the instrumentation you've got that could be venting?

[56 09 53] EECOM
That's affirm, FLIGHT.
> One can imagine EECOM here staring at his readouts and thinking "yes, FLIGHT, everything!"

[56 10 01 - 56 10 03] EECOM
Let me look at the system, FLIGHT, as far as the venting is concerned.

[56 10 03 - 56 10 07] FLIGHT
Okay. Let's start scanning. I assume you've called in your backup EECOMs?

[56 10 10] FLIGHT
EECOM?

[56 10 11] EECOM
FLIGHT, say again?

[56 10 12 - 56 10 15] FLIGHT
Have you called in your backup EECOMS now? See if we can get some more brain power on this thing?

[56 10 15] EECOM
We got one here.

[56 10 16] FLIGHT
Roger.

[56 10 17] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO.

[56 10 18] FLIGHT
Go, INCO.

[56 10 18 - 56 10 21] INCO
He's - he's - never mind, he's straightening up a little bit.

[56 10 21] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 10 45 - 56 11 21] FLIGHT
Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. We've got the LM still attached, the LM spacecraft is good, so {if} we need to get back home we've got a LM to do it with. Let's make sure we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM electrical power with the batteries, or that will cause us to lose the main - the FUEL CELL NUMBER 2. We want to keep the O2 and that kind of stuff working, we'd like to have RCS. But we've got the {Command Module system}, so we're in good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make it any worse by guessin'.
1> Note the repeated use of "if" here. The severity of the problem was not yet fully understood.
2> As noted elsewhere[ref2 p215], FLIGHT likely meant LM here.

[56 11 47] GNC
FLIGHT, GNC.

[56 11 50] FLIGHT
Go, GNC.

[56 11 51 - 56 11 53] GNC
I have some jet configurations for you whenever you need them.

[56 11 54] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 11 57] FLIGHT
Give them to me.

[56 12 01 - 56 12 13] GNC
Okay. Charlie 3, Charlie 4 to MAIN A. Bravo 3 and Bravo 4 to MAIN A. Charlie 1 and Charlie 2 to MAIN A -

[56 12 12] FLIGHT
Standby.

[56 12 21 - 56 12 24] GNC
Yeah; it's all of quad Charlie on MAIN A.

[56 12 24] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 12 25 - 56 12 27] GNC
Plus Bravo 3 and Bravo 4.

[56 12 29 - 56 12 31] FLIGHT
Now, what are we going to be doing with these, GNC?

[56 12 32 - 56 12 34] GNC
That'll give us one jet in each direction on each axis.

[56 12 35] FLIGHT
Okay.

[56 12 36] GUIDO
FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.

[56 12 36] FLIGHT
Go, GUIDANCE.

[56 12 37 - 56 12 39] GUIDO
He's getting close to gimbal lock.

[56 12 39 - 56 12 48] FLIGHT
CAPCOM - okay, CAPCOM, recommend he bring up C-3, C-4, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2 on MAIN A and advise him he's getting close to gimbal lock.

[56 12 52] FLIGHT
GUIDANCE, from FLIGHT.

[56 12 53] GUIDO
Go ahead.

[56 12 53 - 56 13 01] FLIGHT
Could we go to a coarse align on the platform here, so we don't have to use any gas if we need to? We could reorient if necessary.

[56 13 02 - 56 13 05] GUIDO
Roger. I was going to recommend a P52 in a little bit anyway -

[56 13 05 - 56 13 09] FLIGHT
Well, it's going to take a while before we get to the point we're even thinking about a P52.

[56 13 09] GUIDO
Yeah.

[56 13 12 - 56 13 14] FLIGHT
Yeah, it'll coarse align itself there, won't it?

[56 13 17 -] GUIDO
It's coarse align at -

[56 13 19] FLIGHT
Roger.

[- 56 13 20] GUIDO
- any time itself.

[56 14 10 - 56 14 12] FLIGHT
Okay, EECOM. I'm coming back to you.

[56 14 13 -] EECOM
FLIGHT -

[56 14 14] FLIGHT
Go ahead.

[- 56 14 18] EECOM
- I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down.

[56 14 19] FLIGHT
Okay -

[56 14 20 - 56 14 23] EECOM
Let's go down the emergency 1-5.

[56 14 24 - 56 14 28] FLIGHT
You want to power down, let us look at the TM and all that good stuff, and let us come back up.

[56 14 29] EECOM
That's affirm.

[56 14 30] INCO
FLIGHT, INCO. OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 32 - 56 14 33] FLIGHT
You want OMNI Bravo again?

[56 14 34] INCO
Right.

[56 14 34 - 56 14 36] FLIGHT
On board. OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 42 - 56 14 43] FLIGHT
CAPCOM, recommend OMNI Bravo.

[56 14 47 - 56 14 51] FLIGHT
Okay. What - you want to go through power down - give me the page.

[56 14 51 - 56 14 57] EECOM
Emergency 1-5, FLIGHT, we'll go down - try to get a delta of 10 amps reduction.

[56 15 14 - 56 15 15] INCO
Okay, we've got OMNI Bravo, FLIGHT.

[56 15 22 - 56 15 25] FLIGHT
EECOM, do you want to go through that again? What do you want to power down to?

[56 15 25 - 56 15 27] EECOM
I want to power down a total of 10 amps, FLIGHT.

[56 15 28 - 56 15 29] FLIGHT
A total of 10 amps.
> You can hear someone in the background whistle in amazement at this.

[56 15 30] EECOM
That's affirm.
