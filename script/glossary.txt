[technical_terms]
Pitch
One of three measures of a spacecraft's attitude. Think of a plane pointing up or down to climb or descend. Also used to describe the aim of the steerable antenna.

Yaw
One of three measures of a spacecraft's attitude. Think of a car turning left or right. Also used to describe the aim of the steerable antenna.

Roll
One of three measures of a spacecraft's attitude. Think of a can rolling in place.

Rates
The rate of change in the spacecraft's attitude. Sometimes used to express an acceleration rather than a speed: "giving us rates."

Attitude
The way the spacecraft is pointed, relative to the universe.

Quad (Quads)
A pack of four RCS thrusters. The letters A-D (and sometimes phonetic names thereof) referred to different quads on the CSM.

Cryo
Cryogenic (very cold) tanks were used for dense storage of useful gases like Oxygen and Hydrogen. Recall that cold gases take less volume.

Jet
A colloquial term for an RCS thruster.

RCS (A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4)
Reaction Control System; small thrusters used to lightly maneuver the spacecraft, usually to adjust attitude or perform ullage before a full engine burn. They are referred to by their Quad pack name and a number.

Ullage
Fuel [doesn't sit neatly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u656se4e34M#t=1m04) at the bottom of the tank in Zero-G. Ullage is a forward acceleration of the spacecraft around the fuel to push it back to the bottom before a burn.

H2
Hydrogen gas. This was stored in cryogenic tanks and used along with O2 in the fuel cells to produce power and water.

O2
Oxygen gas. This was stored in cryogenic tanks and used along with O2 in the fuel cells to produce power and water, cooling liquid for the glycol thermal control system, and pressurized air for the cabin and spacesuits.

Glycol
A water/glycol mix was circulated around the spacecraft to heat-producing components such as the computer as a cooling system. A combination of heat transfer to cryogenic O2 and evaporation was used to dissipate the heat. Glycol was added to the water as an antifreeze.

DSKY
Display/Keyboard, pronounced "diskey." This was the primary interface between the crew and the Apollo Guidance Computer.

P00
An idle program for the Apollo Guidance Computer. Pronounced "poo." The AGC was never completely idle, but this was as close as it got, and it ensured the AGC wouldn't try to goof up any numbers while the ground controllers were uplinking data to the spacecraft.

Undervolt
An electrical supply or bus that is providing less voltage than expected is undervolting. You can see this in the batteries you use at home: as they get used up, the voltage they put out drops.

PGNCS
Pronounced "pings," the Primary Guidance, Navigation, and Control System was a collective name for a series of components including the IMU, AGC, and star-sighting sextant that collectively provided on-board determination and control of spacecraft position and attitude.

Barber pole
A talkback indicator which read negative displayed a diagonal hatch pattern that looked like a barber pole.

Talkback
Talkback indicators accompanied many switches on the control panel, and provided feedback on the status of the system that switch controls, often indicating whether the switch was actually having the intended effect. They could read grey (positive) or barber pole (negative).

Helium
Helium is often used to this day for its extraordinarily high natural density in spacecraft as an inert repressurization agent as material left a pressurized environment.

BMAG
The two Body Mounted Attitude Gyros served as a backup system to the IMU, tracking the spacecraft attitude. They didn't work the same way as the IMU, and typically provided only rates, not absolute attitude.

Fuel cell
A clever system which reacted H2 and O2 to produce water and electricity. It is essentially like a battery, with a cathode and anode, but with flowing rather than static reactants. There were three on board Apollo, each supplying 31 volts.

DC electrical bus (MAIN A, MAIN B)
The CSM was wired with two direct current electrical loops to its components to supply power to them. Not every component was on both buses. Each could be powered by up to two of the fuel cells.

CSM
Command/Service Module, the name for the mated Command and Sevice Modules. These formed two-thirds of the Apollo spacecraft system, along with the Lunar Module.

Flows
A slang term for electrical current.

AC electrical bus (AC BUS 1, AC BUS 2, AC BUS 3)
There were three inverters connected to the two DC electrical buses in the CSM which transformed the DC power into AC for some of the spacecraft systems. Motors, for instance, are far easier to engineer with AC rather than DC power.

Inverter (INVERTER 1, INVERTER 2, INVERTER 3)
A device that pulls DC power and transforms it into AC power by oscillating its output. You might use one in your car, RV, or boat to power AC devices off a DC battery.

Bipropellant (BI)
A common term for the two fuels that many engines or thrusters burn: either a fuel and an oxidizer for air-igniting systems, or two hypergolic fuels that would automatically ignite and burn upon mutual contact.

Odyssey
The given name of the Apollo 13 Command Module.

Aquarius
The given name of the Apollo 13 Lunar Module.

Systems test
Not every measurement was available directly on a panel gauge or to the telemetry systems. Some readings had to be taken manually off a panel one at a time.

Open-circuit
To break a circuit entirely so it no longer forms a loop. This was as much as one could do to ensure an electrical bus was entirely offline.

Omnidirectional antenna (OMNI Alpha, OMNI Bravor, OMNI Charlie)
The omnidirectional antennas weren't as performant as the steerable antenna at its best, but weren't as fidgety. Multiple were still required, as the spacecraft itself would block signal. Switching between them was manual.

210 (210s)
This referred to big 210-foot antennas on the ground, which were sensitive enough to receive high-bitrate data from the omnidirectional antennas.

Gimbal lock
This famous term refers to the inability of the spacecraft's attitude-tracking gimbals to deal with certain orientations. In gimbal lock, two of the three gyroscopic axes aligned with each other, rendering them unable to turn independently for certain spacecraft movements, which would in turn invalidate the spacecraft alignment and the crew would have to manually realign from star sightings.

DIRECT
Direct-control mode. A spacecraft pilot would use the ACA and TTCA control sticks to directly fire thrusters to move the spacecraft about with no automated interference.

CAPCOM
The Capsule Commander was, with rare exception, the only person allowed to speak directly to the crew. CAPCOMs were nearly always members of the astronaut pool.

FLIGHT
The Flight Director was entrusted to do anything necessary to ensure the safety of the crew and the success of the mission, and had this ultimate authority for the duration of any flight.

EECOM
The Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager managed the lowest level hardware in the CSM for power generation and consumption, electrical distribution, air and water, and the cryogenic gas tanks required for all of the above.

GNC
The Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Systems Engineer monitored the hardware systems that ultimately sent the spacecraft where it had to go: the propulsion and fuel thereof, the navigation computer hardware.

GUIDO
Where GNC managed the navigation and propulsion systems themselves, the Guidance Officer was in charge of their use, as well as the computer software, and tracking the position and orientation of the spacecraft.

INCO
The Integrated Communications Officer managed the communications and telemetry systems of both the CSM and LM. This included the uplink of data to the spacecraft computer.

NETWORK
An oft-ignored but massive system of ground and sea stations were required to maintain round-the-clock communications with the spacecraft. The Network officer managed this process.

TELMU
The Telemetry, Electrical, and EVA Mobility Unit Officer was essentially the EECOM of the Lunar Module, in charge of electrical and environmental hardware systems.

AFD
The Assistant Flight Director worked with FLIGHT on whatever was required at the time, allowing the Flight Director to offload tasks and focus on managing the mission.

CONTROL
The Control Officer was essentially the GNC for the Lunar Module, in charge of the navigational systems and software, as well as the propulsion hardware and fuel.

RETRO
The Retrofire Officer was in charge of any plans and maneuvers necessary to get the crew on a homewards trajectory. Back in the Earth orbit days, this entailed a retrograde burn of an appropriate time and âˆ†V; hence the name.
