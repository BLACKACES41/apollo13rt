This change meant that they left its computer and radio equipment running. This detail will become important later.</p>"},{"epoch":200825,"text":"<p>Together, the Command and Service Modules (referred to as the CSM) would orbit the Moon, while the Lunar Module (LM) would descend to the Lunar surface.</p>"},{"epoch":200832,"text":"<p>To return from the surface, the Lunar Module would leave behind a lot of heavy equipment and fuel to save weight.

We would animate this for you, but it's a 2D drawing. Sorry!</p>"},{"epoch":200870,"text":"<p>Now that we've brought up {{roll}}, this is a good time to talk about {{attitude}}.</p><p>The spacecraft's attitude is its orientation relative to \"the universe.\" It can be described at any time with three values: {{pitch}}, {{roll}}, and {{yaw}}.</p><p>Pitch is like an airplane turning to climb or fall. Roll is like rotating the Apollo hot dog on a stick. And yaw is spinning a spinner on a table.</p>"},{"epoch":200880,"text":"<p>It is important to keep track of the spacecraft's {{attitude}} at all times. Among other reasons, this ensures that when the crew perform burns to correct the spacecraft's trajectory, they know which way to point the vehicle.</p><p>To do this, astronauts turn to the same guides as did mariners upon the ancient sea: the stars.</p><p>By using a variety of telescopes and sextants mounted at known positions on board the spacecraft, such as the Alignment Optical Telescope ({{AOT}}) and Crewman Optical Alignment Sight ({{COAS}}), the astronauts could take readings of known stars and determine their {{attitude}}.</p>"},{"epoch":200888,"text":"<p>They didn't have to do the math, however, or even read out the angles themselves: the Apollo Guidance Computer ({{AGC}}) assisted in this task. During a program P51 from-scratch alignment, the crew could inform the computer once they had pointed the telescope precisely at a known star, and the computer would take a sample. They then needed only to tell it which star it was, and repeat the task for a second star.</p><p>During a P52 alignment confirmation, the computer would even point the telescope automatically at stars, and the crew needed only to adjust and confirm.</p>"},{"epoch":200900,"text":"<p>It is one thing to determine the {{attitude}} at one point in time; it is another to keep it updated as the spacecraft drifted around.

The orientation of the stable member relative to the spacecraft it is mounted to can then be read by {{resolvers}} in the rings.</p>"},{"epoch":200920,"text":"<p>The {{IMU}}, however, is special and advanced. Its stable member is not held stationary by angular momentum.

It'll instead get dragged along, ruining the reference.</p><p>Because of this, the stable member would be deliberately placed at certain angles chosen based on the activities the crew was performing, to minimize the chance this happens. It could be moved quickly but imprecisely, in a {{coarse align}} procedure, or torqued incrementally and carefully as part of a {{fine align}}.</p>"},{"epoch":200940,"text":"<p>The combination of maintaining a healthy IMU and understanding the spacecraft's {{attitude}} was called a {{platform}}. When you hear people in the audio refer to the platform, this is what they mean.</p><p>Even if everything was done correctly, the IMU could drift over time, and the platform would need to be recalibrated. A P52 was usually done to accomplish this reconfirmation, after which the IMU might be adjusted slightly with a {{fine align}} operation.</p>"},{"epoch":200952,"text":"<p>Once you know your attitude reference, you'll want to use it to go places.

It could also automatically perform crew-defined maneuvers to safely drift around to a new target attitude.</p><p>The hand controllers could be used to change the attitude in this {{Attitude Hold}} mode. In this case, the spacecraft will automatically fire opposing thrusters to halt the spacecraft's rotation once the controller was released.</p>"},{"epoch":201000,"text":"<p>In manual flight, the crew could still rely on the electronics to condition their inputs.

In both of these modes, the crew was responsible for manually halting any rotation of the vehicle.</p>"},{"epoch":201015,"text":"<p>If the electronics were not available or trustworthy, {{Direct}} RCS mode wired the hand controllers straight to a dedicated set of solenoids to fire the thrusters.
